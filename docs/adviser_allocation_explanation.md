# Adviser Allocation System: Process Results and Importance

## Executive Summary

The Adviser Allocation System is an automated workflow that intelligently assigns client deals to financial advisers based on availability, expertise, and workload balancing. This document outlines the system's results and business importance.

---

## System Overview

The system integrates three key platforms:
- **HubSpot CRM** - Deal management and adviser assignments
- **Employment Hero** - HR data including leave requests
- **Firestore** - Data persistence and allocation history

---

## Process Results

### Primary Output

#### 1. Optimal Adviser Assignment
The system automatically assigns incoming client deals to the most suitable financial adviser based on:

- **Earliest Availability**: Considers scheduled meetings, approved leave, and current capacity
- **Service Package Expertise**: Matches client needs to adviser specializations
- **Workload Balancing**: Uses sophisticated tiebreaker ratios to distribute work fairly

#### 2. HubSpot Integration
The system seamlessly updates the HubSpot CRM by:
- Setting the `advisor` property on the deal record
- Assigning the deal to the selected adviser's HubSpot owner ID
- Creating a complete audit trail of allocation decisions

### Supporting Outputs

#### Capacity Analysis
- Weekly capacity tables showing:
  - Clarify meetings scheduled
  - Leave status (Full/Partial/No)
  - Target capacity vs. actual workload
  - Projected availability

#### Availability Forecasting
- Projects adviser availability 52+ weeks into the future
- Accounts for upcoming leave and office closures
- Considers future starter dates (advisers can receive clients up to 3 weeks before start date)

#### Allocation History
- Stores all allocation decisions in Firestore
- Maintains detailed logs for compliance and analysis
- Tracks success/failure rates and error handling

## Business Importance

### 1. Operational Efficiency

#### Eliminates Manual Processes
- **Before**: Managers manually reviewed adviser availability and assigned clients
- **After**: Automated real-time allocation via HubSpot webhooks
- **Impact**: Reduces allocation time from hours to seconds

#### Scalable Operations
- Handles multiple simultaneous allocations
- No human bottlenecks in the assignment process
- Consistent allocation criteria across all deals

### 2. Enhanced Client Experience

#### Faster Client Onboarding
- Clients assigned to advisers immediately upon deal creation
- No delays waiting for manual review and assignment
- Improved time-to-service metrics

#### Optimal Client-Adviser Matching
- Ensures clients receive advisers with appropriate expertise
- Matches service packages to adviser specializations
- Prevents mismatched assignments that could impact service quality

### 3. Resource Optimization

#### Intelligent Load Balancing
The system uses sophisticated algorithms to:
- Distribute work evenly across the adviser team
- Account for individual capacity limits (4-6 clients per month based on experience)
- Consider adviser tenure and pod type (Solo vs. Team advisers)

#### Forward-Looking Capacity Planning
- Analyzes upcoming leave requests from Employment Hero
- Accounts for office closures and public holidays
- Projects capacity constraints weeks in advance

### 4. Data-Driven Decision Making

#### Comprehensive Data Integration
The system considers multiple data sources:
- **HubSpot**: Scheduled clarify meetings and deal pipeline
- **Employment Hero**: Approved leave requests and employee data
- **Firestore**: Historical allocation patterns and office closures

#### Predictive Analytics
- Uses fortnightly targets and backlog management
- Calculates when advisers will have capacity for new clients
- Provides earliest available week predictions

### 5. Risk Management and Compliance

#### Prevents Overallocation
- Enforces monthly client limits per adviser
- Accounts for adviser experience levels and pod structures
- Maintains buffer periods to prevent scheduling conflicts

#### Comprehensive Audit Trail
- Records all allocation decisions with timestamps
- Tracks request sources and IP addresses
- Maintains error logs for troubleshooting

#### Graceful Error Handling
- Manages edge cases (no available advisers, system errors)
- Provides fallback mechanisms and retry logic
- Maintains service continuity during outages

### 6. Web Application Dashboard for Monitoring

#### Real-Time System Oversight
The system includes a comprehensive web dashboard that provides:

- **Live Allocation Monitoring**: Real-time view of allocation requests and their status
- **Adviser Availability Overview**: Current capacity and earliest available weeks for all advisers
- **System Health Metrics**: Performance indicators, error rates, and uptime statistics
- **Historical Analytics**: Trends in allocation patterns, adviser utilization, and client distribution

#### Management Tools
The dashboard offers powerful management capabilities:

- **Availability Scheduling**: Visual interface to view and analyze adviser schedules
- **Office Closure Management**: Tools to add and manage global office closures and holidays
- **Employee Leave Tracking**: Integration with Employment Hero to display current and upcoming leave
- **Allocation History**: Searchable log of all allocation decisions with detailed audit trails

#### Operational Benefits
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Early identification of capacity constraints or system issues
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Visual analytics for optimizing adviser workloads and client assignments
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Centralized management of system parameters and configurations
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into allocation decisions for management and compliance

#### Key Dashboard Features
- **Interactive Capacity Tables**: Week-by-week view of each adviser's schedule and availability
- **Allocation Request Tracking**: Status monitoring from webhook receipt to HubSpot update
- **Performance Dashboards**: Metrics on allocation speed, success rates, and system reliability
- **User Authentication**: Secure access controls to protect sensitive adviser and client data

## Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm Features

#### Capacity Calculation
```
Target Capacity = Client Limit Monthly รท 2 (fortnightly basis)
Actual Capacity = Clarify Meetings + Deals without Clarify
Available Capacity = Target - Actual
```

#### Earliest Week Determination
1. **Initialize**: Set baseline week (minimum 2 weeks from current date)
2. **Load Data**: Gather meetings, leave, and deal data
3. **Calculate Backlog**: Process existing deals without clarify meetings
4. **Project Forward**: Walk through fortnightly periods consuming backlog
5. **Find Availability**: Identify first week where capacity becomes available

#### Tiebreaker Logic
When multiple advisers have the same earliest availability:
1. Calculate workload ratios (clarify count รท target capacity)
2. Select adviser with lowest ratio
3. If still tied, random selection ensures fairness

### Integration Points

#### HubSpot Webhook (`/post/allocate`)
- Receives deal creation events
- Extracts service package and agreement start date
- Triggers allocation algorithm
- Updates deal owner in HubSpot

#### Employment Hero OAuth
- Syncs employee data and leave requests
- Maintains current HR information
- Supports capacity calculations

#### Firestore Database
- Stores allocation history
- Caches employee and leave data
- Manages office closure schedules
